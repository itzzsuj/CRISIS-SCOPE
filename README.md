# Crisis-Scope: Disaster Management Website

This project, Crisis-Scope, is a disaster management website built using React, with Firebase as the backend store. Users can log in, send rescue requests, and interact with a rescue team. Rescue teams receive the requests in real-time, while admins can view all the requests and access a heat map representing disaster-affected areas.
